# CVAP Tool
## This is the Computer Vision Analysis Profiling Tool

This tool allows for generated report creation, similar to already established tools like ydata-profiling (pandas-profiling) or sweetviz.

This set of scripts was created for the Human-Computer Interaction Class at the Ã–rebro University in Sweden, fall semester 2024.

To run:
```console
foo@bar:~$ python main.py --mode (single/compare) --input ./dir --output ./dir/report
```
